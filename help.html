variety of coffee pods, but feel free to bring your own coffee devices and/or

</p>

<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>
CampJS attendees must read our code of conduct and know we are very serious
about making sure CampJS is a safe and welcoming environment for everyone. We
will not tolerate any sort of harassment or exclusionary activities. All
attendees are expected to use their most mature, inclusive and least-prejudiced
behaviour for the duration of the event.
</p>

<p>
If you'd like to report any issues, do not hesitate to approach Wei Lu or Tim
Oxley. Alternatively, email us both at codeofconduct@campjs.com.
</p>


<h2>THINGS TO BRING</h2>

<h4>Warm Clothes</h4>
e.g. Jackets, Scarves, gloves, onesies. It's going to be pretty cold.
<p>
</p>

<h4>Swimmers</h4>

<p>
The venue is right next to the ocean! Please bring appropriate swimwear, especially if you're planning to
participate in the NodeBoats workshop. We have also organised to use the venue's
Kayaks.
</p>

<h4>Sleeping Bag + Pillow</h4>

<p>
It's going to be rather cool weather. I recommend bringing a sleeping bag. Maybe pack an extra blanket. If you cannot bring such items the venue has packs that can be hired for $30.
</p>

<h4>Earplugs</h4>

<p>
I cannot guarantee it won't be noisy at night. If you're concerned about getting a good night's rest without pooping anyone's parties, please bring along earplugs. I personally sleep with earplugs every night and it is bliss for me and convenient for others. If you don't bring earplugs, I don't want to hear you complaining about noise.
</p>

<h4>Bathroom equipment – including Towel</h4>

<p>
The usual – towel, toothbrush, shampoo, soap, deodorant, etc.
</p>

<h4>Additional Drinks</h4>

<p>
Unlimited beer, red/white wine, cider, juice, coffee and soft-drink is provided courtesy of CampJS. You're welcome to bring harder liquors if you so desire.
</p>

<h4>Snacks to Share</h4>

<p>
If everyone brings a little something to share there will always be something to nibble on. Please bring enough snacks to share :D
</p>

<h4>Computer, Phone and Associated Chargers</h4>

<p>
Power boards will be available but probably bring more (please put your name on them so we don't accidentally steal them).
</p>

<h4>Headphones</h4>

<p>
We are honoured to have DJ Vagg providing music in the main hall, but if you want to listen to something different, please do so from the comfort of your own headphones.
</p>

<h4>Instruments</h4>

<p>
Many of us are musicians, I would love to be able to set up some jam sessions… especially if we can hook it up to some .js! Please bring guitars, mics, tubas, drums, etc.
</p>

<h4>Medications</h4>

<p>
Death and illness is likely to be inconvenient for everyone involved, so please don't forget to bring anything that may prevent incidents.
</p>

<h4>Warm Clothes</h4>

<p>
Remember to bring warm clothes.
</p>

<h4>Tools for coping with no Internet</h4>

<p>
We will work to have a great intranet but you should not rely on having any Internet. There will be a copy of cdnjs and npm on the intranet.
</p>

<p>
Here are some essentials you may want to install/familiarise yourself with prior to CampJS III:
</p>

<li>node/npm: (Installation guide by Benjamin Lupton</li>
<li>npmd (gives you a local npm repo)</li>
<li>Google Chrome/Canary </li>
<li>git</li>
<li>Homebrew, if you're on OSX</li>
<li>Dash for OSX, great offline documentation viewer</li>
<li>A decent text editor. If you're not already using vim, then perhaps try SublimeText or something like WebStorm/WebMatrix</li>
<li>Windows users may want to dual boot to linux, or a VM or installing a unix-like terminal such as cygwin</li>

<h4>Hardware to play with</h4>

<p>
If you've been playing with or building any cool hardware, bring it along and show it off.
</p>

<h4>Book Swap</h4>
<p>
Are you going to read all those books in the next year? No, probably not, be realistic! Please bring along any half-decent technical books you're not going to read so someone else can!
</p>

<h4>#campjs</h4>
<p>
You can find CampJS in various places around the internet:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Slack Gitter</li>
<li>#campjs on Freenode</li>
<li>Google+</li>
<li>Github</li>
<li>campjs.com</li>
</ul>
<p>
I want CampJS to be net-positive for the global JavaScript community and the most fun & rewarding event it possibly can be. The more noise we make to our friends and on social networks the easier it is for me to move tickets and attract sponsors & speakers to the next camp (later this year!). This in turn makes CampJS better for everyone.
</p>

<p>
If something about CampJS sucks – tell me so I can fix it. I am very open to feedback. If something about CampJS is good – tell others so we can continue doing the same!
</p>

<p>
If you want to make any announcements to the CampJS audience prior to CampJS, tweet @campjsnews and I'll retweet it.
</p>

<p>
Note it will be rather cold in the evenings so please don't forget to rug up.
</p>

<p>
Do contact me or open an issue if you have any further questions.
